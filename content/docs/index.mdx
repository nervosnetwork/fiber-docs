title: What is Fiber Network?
---

[Fiber network](https://www.fiber.world/) is a peer-to-peer payment/swap network (like [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/)). 
We believe payment and swap are the two foundational primitives of finance.
[Fiber Network Node (FNN)](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber) is a reference node implementation of Fiber Network Protocol (FNP).

## Features

- **Multiple assets support**, e.g. stable coins, RGB++ assets issued on Bitcoin ledger, and UDT assets issued on CKB ledger;
- **Extremely low-cost micropayments**, e.g. 0.0001 cent payment with 0.00000001 cent fee;
- **Instant swap between any asset pairs**, as long as there's available channel paths;
- **Cross-network asset payment/swap**, e.g. from Lightning network to Fiber network, and vice versa;
- **Watchtower support**, make it easier for node operators;
- **Multi-hop payment**, anyone can facilitate payments and earn payment fees by running a fiber node and becoming a hop on payment paths;
- **Low latency**, e.g. 0.0001 cent payment in your p2p connection latency, e.g. 20ms;
- **High throughput**, because transactions are only processed by involved peers, no network consensus required;
- **High privacy**, your transactions are only seen by involved peers;
- **Based on more advanced cryptographic techniques** to ensure security and privacy, e.g. uses PTLC not HTLC;
- **Composable** with other contracts/scripts on CKB;

Note: The implementation is still a work-in-progress and will have iterations even after mainnet, 
please use it with caution and report any issues/limitations in the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber/issues).

## TODO

- [x] Establishing connections with other fiber nodes
- [x] Creating and closing fiber channel
- [x] Payments over fiber channel (via [fiber-scripts])
- [x] Cross-network asset transfer
- [ ] Web-browser friendly runtime
- [ ] Programmable conditional payment
- [ ] Advanced channel liquidity management
- [ ] Atomic multi-path payment
